DevEn - Command line tool for creating LAMP developpement environements with a single command.
DevEn will create the necessary folders, create an apache virtual host and add
a new entry in the /etc/hosts file so that your domain (local or FQDN) will 
immediately be visible locally in your browser.
You must have root privileges to run DevEn, so you should either be logged in 
as root or use sudo.

Usage:
 deven [options] domain.name

Options:
 -u --user sets the user. By default, current user will be used.
 -p --path project will be created using this path rather than the default one.
 -l --list list existing domains 

 -h --help outputs this help
 --prompt gathers information using prompt rather than command line arguments
